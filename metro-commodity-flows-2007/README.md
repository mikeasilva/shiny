# 2007 Metro Commodity Flow Visualizer

## Who feeds Paris?
This is the economist's way of drawing attention to the myriad of ways things happen to make the modern economy work.  You can begin to understand the complexity by observing trade flows captured by the commodity flow survey.

## How it works
This application allows the users to select a direction (i.e. inflows or outflows) and a metropolitan area and instantly a map of their trade network emerges.  The user can also view the underlying data.

## About the data
The Commodity Flow Survey (CFS), undertaken through a partnership between the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) is conducted every 5 years (years ending in "2" and "7") as part of the Economic Census. The CFS produces data on the movement of goods in the United States. It provides information on commodities shipped, their value, weight, and mode of transportation, as well as the origin and destination of shipments of commodities from manufacturing, mining, wholesale, and selected retail and services establishments.

At the time this application was developed the 2007 data was the latest available.  The data was download from the census's website (http://www.census.gov/econ/cfs/).  

We chose to display the value of the commodities in aggregate flowing from one metro area to another.  Since metros can span more than one state the CFS broke the individual metro's data out into components.  It was aggregated back up into metro level data and names were simplified.  Honolulu HI's data was removed from the data set to allow for cleaner presentation of the trade maps.
